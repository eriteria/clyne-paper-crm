## 🚨 Required Post-Import Actions

### 1. Reset Relationship Manager Passwords (HIGH PRIORITY)

All relationship manager users were created with the default password: **`ChangeMe123!`**

**Action Required:**

```bash
# Option A: Use CRM admin panel to reset passwords
# Option B: Use forgot password feature on login page
# Option C: Create password reset script
```

**Users needing password reset:**

- joy.akinyele@clynepaper.com
- amarachi.nwabu-nwosu@clynepaper.com
- godwin.omede@clynepaper.com
- collins.osiobe@clynepaper.com
- kamil.haruna@clynepaper.com
- chimdia.okey-ebere@clynepaper.com

### 2. Set Up Inventory Items (REQUIRED for Invoice Line Items)

**Issue:** Invoice line items could NOT be imported because they require `InventoryItems` to exist first.

**Current Status:**

- 22 Products exist
- 0 Inventory Items exist at locations
- 2,285 Invoices created WITHOUT line items

**Action Required:**

1. For each product, create `InventoryItem` records at each location (Abuja Corporate Sales, Factory, etc.)
2. Set initial stock quantities, unit prices, SKUs
3. After inventory items exist, add invoice line items manually via CRM UI

**Process:**

```typescript
// Example: Create inventory item for "CLYNE BATH TISSUE" at Abuja Corporate Sales
POST /api/inventory-items
{
  "name": "CLYNE BATH TISSUE",
  "sku": "CBT-001",
  "unit": "pack",
  "unitPrice": 5500.00,
  "currentQuantity": 100,
  "minStock": 10,
  "locationId": "abuja-corporate-sales-location-id"
}
```

### 3. Assign Users to Teams and Regions

**Current Status:**

- 7 relationship manager users exist
- All users have `roleId` set to "Sales"
- None assigned to teams or regions yet

**Action Required:**

1. Create/verify Teams exist (if not already created)
2. Create/verify Regions exist
3. Assign each relationship manager to appropriate team and region via admin panel

### 4. Configure Team-Location Mappings

**Current Status:**

- 6 locations created
- 373 customers assigned to locations
- Team-Location mappings not configured

**Action Required:**

```bash
# Run the team-location setup script
cd backend
npx ts-node src/scripts/setup-location-teams.ts
```

This will:

- Map teams to locations they serve
- Enable proper data access control based on team assignments

### 5. Verify Invoice Balances and Status

**Current Status:**

- 8 payment applications created (₦429,304 total)
- Invoice statuses calculated: OPEN, PAID, PARTIAL

**Action to Verify:**

1. Spot check a few invoices to ensure balances are correct
2. Verify payment applications linked properly
3. Confirm invoice statuses match expected (PAID = balance 0, PARTIAL = balance < total, OPEN = balance = total)

**SQL Query to Check:**

```sql
SELECT
  i."invoice_number",
  i."total_amount",
  i."balance",
  i."status",
  COUNT(pa.id) as payment_count,
  SUM(pa."amount_applied") as total_paid
FROM invoices i
LEFT JOIN payment_applications pa ON pa."invoice_id" = i.id
GROUP BY i.id
ORDER BY i."date" DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 6. Handle Import Warnings

**Date Parsing Issues:**

- 4 customer dates couldn't be parsed:
  - YELLOW DOOR APARTMENTS: "2nd June 2025"
  - OLUWATOYIN OMONAIVE: "2nd June 2025"
  - ADAUGO (FCMB PLAZA): "29/04"
  - MEDIX PLUS PHARMACY: "29/04/25"

**Action:** Manually update these customer onboarding/last order dates in the CRM

**Missing Customers:**

- 3 invoices referenced customers not found in customer sheet:
  - Invoice #1890: "FIRST BANK MAITAMA"
  - Invoice #3408: "Cosmos"
  - Invoice #3378: "GOD SUPERMARKET" (note double space in original)

**Action:** Either:

- Create these customers manually in CRM
- Update invoices to link to existing similar customers
- Mark these invoices as invalid

**Missing Data:**

- Invoice #0143: Skipped due to missing customer or date

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Import Fails with "Customer not found"

**Cause:** Customer name in invoice sheet doesn't match customer name in customer sheet exactly
**Fix:** Update customer names in Google Sheets to match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Import Creates Duplicate Customers

**Cause:** Customer name differs slightly (extra spaces, punctuation)
**Fix:** Standardize customer names in Google Sheets before re-importing

### Relationship Manager Login Fails

**Cause:** Default password not changed, or password incorrectly set
**Fix:** Use password reset feature or admin panel to set new password

### Invoice Balances Incorrect

**Cause:** Payment applications not created or amounts wrong
**Fix:** Review payment applications in database, recalculate balances manually

### Inventory Items Missing

**Cause:** Inventory items must be created manually after products exist
**Fix:** Follow "Set Up Inventory Items" section above
