## 🔄 Current System Status

**Servers Running**: ✅ Backend (5000) + Frontend (3000)  
**Database Schema**: ✅ Ready for migration  
**Authentication**: ✅ JWT system implemented  
**API Foundation**: ✅ Basic structure complete

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. **Database Setup** (Required first)

```bash
# You need to run these commands:
cd backend
npx prisma migrate dev --name init  # Create initial migration
npm run db:seed                     # Populate with sample data
```

### 2. **Authentication Middleware**

- Create JWT validation middleware
- Implement role-based access control
- Add authentication to protected routes

### 3. **Core API Routes**

- **Users Management**: CRUD operations, role assignments
- **Inventory Management**: List, create, update items
- **Invoice System**: Create invoices with inventory updates
- **Waybill System**: Process incoming stock

### 4. **Frontend Pages**

- Login page with authentication
- Dashboard with KPI cards
- Inventory management interface
- Invoice creation form

### 5. **Business Logic**

- Inventory quantity updates (waybills +, invoices -)
- Transaction safety (database locks)
- Audit logging for all operations

## 📋 Test Plan

Once database is set up, you can test:

1. **API Authentication**:

   ```bash
   # Test login
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login" -Method POST -Headers @{"Content-Type"="application/json"} -Body '{"email":"admin@clynepaper.com","password":"password123"}'
   ```

2. **Access all route stubs**:

   - http://localhost:5000/api/users
   - http://localhost:5000/api/inventory
   - http://localhost:5000/api/invoices

3. **Frontend access**: http://localhost:3000

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The system will be ready for initial use when:

- [ ] Database migrations run successfully
- [ ] Sample data loaded (users, inventory, teams)
- [ ] Authentication system fully working
- [ ] Basic CRUD operations for all entities
- [ ] Invoice creation updates inventory correctly
- [ ] Role-based access control enforced
- [ ] Basic frontend interfaces operational

## 🔧 Technical Architecture Confirmed

**Backend Stack**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript + Prisma + PostgreSQL  
**Frontend Stack**: Next.js 15 + TailwindCSS + React Query  
**Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens  
**Database**: PostgreSQL (primary), MySQL fallback for cPanel  
**Deployment**: Node.js preferred, Laravel fallback documented

## 📁 Current Project Size

**Backend**: ~20 files, core infrastructure complete  
**Frontend**: ~5 files, basic Next.js setup  
**Documentation**: Comprehensive setup and progress docs  
**Database**: 10 tables, full schema ready

The foundation is solid and ready for rapid feature development!
