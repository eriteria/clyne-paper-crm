# Bank Accounts System - PDF Integration Complete

## What Was Done

The invoice PDF generation has been successfully updated to use the new bank accounts system from the database instead of hard-coded values.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Invoice Query (Line ~450)

- Added `bankAccount: true` to the include clause
- Added support for `?bankAccountId=xxx` query parameter override
- Now fetches the linked bank account along with invoice data

### 2. Dynamic Bank Account Display (Line ~540)

The PDF now intelligently selects which bank account to display:

**Priority Order:**

1. **Override Parameter** - If `?bankAccountId=xxx` is provided in the URL
2. **Invoice's Linked Account** - If the invoice has a `bankAccountId`
3. **Default Account** - Falls back to the account with ID `default-bank-account`

**Display Logic:**

- **If `paymentMethod = 'CASH'`**: Shows "PAYMENT METHOD: CASH"
- **If bank account found**: Shows "ACCOUNT NAME: [name] ACCOUNT NO: [number] BANK: [bank]"
- **If no account found**: Shows "PAYMENT METHOD: BANK TRANSFER" (fallback)

## API Usage

### Basic PDF Download

```http
GET /api/invoices/{invoiceId}/pdf
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

Uses the invoice's linked bank account, or default if none.

### Override Bank Account

```http
GET /api/invoices/{invoiceId}/pdf?bankAccountId={accountId}
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

Allows selecting a different bank account at PDF generation time.

## Testing

### Test 1: Default Bank Account (No Payment Method Set)

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/invoices/{invoiceId}/pdf \
  --output invoice.pdf
```

**Expected:** PDF shows "CLYNE PAPER LIMITED / 2045723876 / FIRST BANK"

### Test 2: Cash Payment

First, update an invoice to use cash:

```bash
curl -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"paymentMethod": "CASH"}' \
  http://localhost:5000/api/invoices/{invoiceId}
```

Then download PDF:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/invoices/{invoiceId}/pdf \
  --output invoice-cash.pdf
```

**Expected:** PDF shows "PAYMENT METHOD: CASH"

### Test 3: Bank Transfer with Specific Account

First, create a new bank account (if needed):

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "accountName": "CLYNE PAPER LIMITED",
    "accountNumber": "9876543210",
    "bankName": "ZENITH BANK"
  }' \
  http://localhost:5000/api/bank-accounts
```

Update invoice with that account:

```bash
curl -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "paymentMethod": "BANK_TRANSFER",
    "bankAccountId": "{newAccountId}"
  }' \
  http://localhost:5000/api/invoices/{invoiceId}
```

Download PDF:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/invoices/{invoiceId}/pdf \
  --output invoice-bank.pdf
```

**Expected:** PDF shows the new bank account details

### Test 4: Override at PDF Generation

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:5000/api/invoices/{invoiceId}/pdf?bankAccountId={differentAccountId}" \
  --output invoice-override.pdf
```

**Expected:** PDF shows the overridden bank account, ignoring invoice's linked account

## Implementation Details

### Code Structure

```typescript
// 1. Check for override parameter
const bankAccountIdOverride = req.query.bankAccountId as string | undefined;

// 2. Fetch invoice with bank account
const invoice = await prisma.invoice.findUnique({
  where: { id },
  include: {
    // ... other includes
    bankAccount: true,
  },
});

// 3. Determine which account to display
let bankAccountToDisplay: any = null;

if (bankAccountIdOverride) {
  // Use override
  bankAccountToDisplay = await prisma.bankAccount.findUnique({
    where: { id: bankAccountIdOverride },
  });
} else if (invoice.bankAccount) {
  // Use invoice's account
  bankAccountToDisplay = invoice.bankAccount;
} else {
  // Use default
  bankAccountToDisplay = await prisma.bankAccount.findUnique({
    where: { id: 'default-bank-account' },
  });
}

// 4. Display based on payment method
if (invoice.paymentMethod === 'CASH') {
  doc.text('PAYMENT METHOD: CASH', ...);
} else if (bankAccountToDisplay) {
  doc.text(`ACCOUNT NAME: ${bankAccountToDisplay.accountName} ...`, ...);
} else {
  doc.text('PAYMENT METHOD: BANK TRANSFER', ...);
}
```

### TypeScript Note

The code uses `any` type for `bankAccountToDisplay` due to VS Code TypeScript service not recognizing the BankAccount type from the newly generated Prisma Client. This is a cosmetic issue - the code compiles and runs correctly with `ts-node-dev --transpile-only`.

To resolve (if needed):

1. Restart VS Code
2. Run "TypeScript: Restart TS Server" command
3. Or accept the `any` type (it's safe in this context)

## Backward Compatibility

**Existing Invoices:**

- Invoices created before this update have `paymentMethod = NULL` and `bankAccountId = NULL`
- These will automatically show the default bank account
- No data migration required - works out of the box

**Recommendation:**
Consider running a bulk update to set all existing invoices to use the default bank account:

```sql
UPDATE invoices
SET payment_method = 'BANK_TRANSFER',
    bank_account_id = 'default-bank-account'
WHERE payment_method IS NULL;
```

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Frontend Implementation

**Priority 1:** Invoice Form Updates

- Add payment method dropdown (Cash/Bank Transfer)
- Add bank account selector (conditional on Bank Transfer)
- Hook: `useBankAccounts()` to fetch available accounts
- Save both fields when creating/updating invoices

**Priority 2:** PDF Download Modal

- Create modal to preview/override bank account before download
- Show current payment method and account
- Allow changing bank account
- Pass `bankAccountId` parameter to PDF endpoint

**Priority 3:** Admin Management Page

- File: `frontend/src/app/admin/bank-accounts/page.tsx`
- CRUD interface for bank accounts
- View linked invoices/payments count
- Toggle active/inactive status

**Priority 4:** Payment Recording

- Add bank account selector to payment forms
- Link payments to specific accounts in database

**Priority 5:** Reporting

- Bank account transactions report
- Filter by date range and account
- Show total amounts per account
- Export to CSV

## Status Summary

✅ **Backend Complete:**

- Database schema updated
- Migration applied
- Bank accounts API endpoints created
- Invoice PDF generation updated
- Default bank account seeded
- Backend server running successfully

⏳ **Frontend Pending:**

- Invoice form bank account selection
- PDF download bank account override modal
- Admin bank accounts management page
- Payment recording with bank accounts
- Bank account transactions report

## Known Issues

1. **VS Code TypeScript Errors**: Shows type errors for `bankAccountToDisplay` variable, but code compiles and runs fine. This is because VS Code's TypeScript service hasn't picked up the new Prisma Client types yet.

   **Solution**: Ignore the red squiggles, or restart VS Code/TS Server.

2. **Missing Bank Account Handling**: If no bank account exists at all (default deleted), PDF shows "PAYMENT METHOD: BANK TRANSFER" as fallback. This should rarely happen in production.

   **Solution**: Ensure at least one bank account is always active.

## Deployment Notes

Before deploying to production:

1. ✅ Test PDF generation with different payment methods
2. ☐ Run migration in production database
3. ☐ Seed production bank accounts
4. ☐ Test PDF downloads in staging environment
5. ☐ Update user documentation
6. ☐ Train users on bank account selection workflow

**Status:** ✅ Phase 1 Complete - PDF Integration Done  
**Next:** Frontend implementation  
**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0
