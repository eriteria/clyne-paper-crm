## How It Works

### Architecture

```
Google Sheets (Data Entry)
    ‚Üì
Service Account Authentication
    ‚Üì
Google Sheets API
    ‚Üì
Import Script (import-from-google-sheets.ts)
    ‚Üì
Prisma ORM
    ‚Üì
PostgreSQL Database
    ‚Üì
CRM Application
```

### Import Process

1. **Product Groups** ‚Üí Foundation for products
2. **Products** ‚Üí Linked to product groups
3. **Customers** ‚Üí Creates relationship manager users first with bcrypt hashing
4. **Invoices** ‚Üí Created with customer links, balances (NO line items yet)
5. **Payments** ‚Üí Creates CustomerPayment + PaymentApplication records

### Key Features

- üîí **Secure:** bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds)
- üîÑ **Idempotent:** Safe to re-run without creating duplicates
- üõ°Ô∏è **Validated:** Checks foreign keys, skips invalid records
- üí∞ **Currency Smart:** Parses ‚Ç¶25,500.00 ‚Üí 25500.00
- üìÖ **Date Smart:** Parses "5 Jun 2025" ‚Üí 2025-06-05
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Error Handling:** Logs errors, continues processing

## What's Next

### Immediate (High Priority) üî¥

1. **Reset Passwords** - All 6 relationship managers have default password "ChangeMe123!"
2. **Set Up Inventory Items** - Required before adding invoice line items (22 products √ó 2 locations = 44 items minimum)
3. **Fix Date Issues** - 4 customers have unparseable dates
4. **Handle Missing Customers** - 3 invoices reference customers not in database

### This Week üü°

1. Assign relationship managers to teams and regions
2. Configure team-location mappings
3. Review invoice balances (spot check)
4. Test relationship manager logins

### This Month üü¢

1. Add invoice line items (start with priority invoices)
2. Train relationship managers on CRM
3. Set up automated sync schedule
4. Create reporting dashboards

**Full Details:** See `docs/POST_IMPORT_CHECKLIST.md`

## Known Limitations

### Invoice Line Items Not Imported

**Why:** `InvoiceItem` requires `inventoryItemId` which requires `InventoryItem` records to exist first.

**Workaround:**

1. Create inventory items for each product at each location
2. Add invoice line items manually via CRM UI for priority invoices

### Default Passwords

**Issue:** All relationship manager users created with password "ChangeMe123!"

**Fix:** Use admin panel or password reset feature to set secure passwords

### Date Parsing Issues

**Problem:** 4 customers have dates in non-standard format ("2nd June 2025", "29/04")

**Fix:** Manually update these customers in Prisma Studio or CRM admin panel

### Missing Customers

**Problem:** 3 invoices reference customers not found in customer sheet:

- Invoice #1890: "FIRST BANK MAITAMA"
- Invoice #3408: "Cosmos" (likely "COSMOS SUPERMARKET")
- Invoice #3378: "GOD SUPERMARKET" (likely "GOD FIRST SUPERMARKET")

**Fix:** Either create these customers or update invoices to link to correct existing customers

## Technical Details

### Schema Compatibility (FIXED)

The import script was completely rewritten to work with the actual Prisma schema:

**User Model:**

- ‚úÖ Uses `fullName`, `passwordHash` (bcrypt), `roleId` (FK to Role)
- ‚úÖ Creates "Sales" role if not exists
- ‚úÖ Assigns all relationship managers to Sales role

**Product Model:**

- ‚úÖ Uses `productGroupId` (required FK)
- ‚úÖ Imports product groups before products
- ‚úÖ Creates default "General Products" group if needed

**Customer Model:**

- ‚úÖ Uses `locationId` (required FK)
- ‚úÖ Creates location if missing
- ‚úÖ Links to relationship manager user
- ‚úÖ Stores `onboardingDate` and `lastOrderDate`

**Invoice Model:**

- ‚úÖ Uses `billedByUserId` (relationship manager)
- ‚úÖ Stores `customerName` for backward compatibility
- ‚úÖ Calculates and stores `balance` field
- ‚úÖ Sets status (OPEN/PARTIAL/PAID) based on balance

**Payment Model:**

- ‚úÖ Uses `CustomerPayment` + `PaymentApplication` pattern
- ‚úÖ `CustomerPayment` records payment details
- ‚úÖ `PaymentApplication` links payment to specific invoice(s)
- ‚úÖ Updates invoice balance when payment applied

### Google Sheets Structure

**Database Sheet (ID: 1NLzldesyGsAXR-UfWnX6ax37sZ42MbD0b7PiIMi9hf4):**

- Tab: `CUSTOMERS` - Customer details, relationship managers, locations
- Tab: `PRODUCT GROUPS AND TARGETS` - Product categories
- Tab: `PRODUCTS` - Product catalog with groups
- Tab: `SALES TEAM` - Relationship manager information

**Master Sheet (ID: 1wURUIeMCe1AERYzI6Q7DIofuBJQwq\_\_-GMKNjGW3IpE):**

- Tab: `INVOICE LIST` - Invoice details with customer names
- Tab: `PAYMENTS` - Payment records with reference numbers

### Authentication

- Uses **Service Account** with JSON credentials
- Credentials file: `backend/google-credentials.json` (NOT in git)
- Sheets must be shared with service account email
