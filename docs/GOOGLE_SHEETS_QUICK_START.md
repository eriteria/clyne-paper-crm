## üéØ What This Does

Automatically import your data from Google Sheets into the CRM:

- **Invoices** from Master sheet ‚Üí Invoice + InvoiceItem tables
- **Payments** from Master sheet ‚Üí Payment table

All relationships are automatically linked!

## üöÄ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Create Google Service Account

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create project: "Clyne Paper CRM"
3. Enable "Google Sheets API"
4. Create Service Account:
   - Name: `clyne-crm-sheets-reader`
   - Role: "Editor" or "Viewer"
5. Create JSON key ‚Üí Downloads as JSON file
6. Rename to `google-credentials.json`
7. Move to `backend/google-credentials.json`

### 2. Share Your Sheets

1. Open `google-credentials.json`
2. Copy the `client_email` (looks like `xxxx@xxxx.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
3. Share BOTH Google Sheets with this email:
   - Database Sheet
   - Master Sheet
   - Permission: "Viewer"

### 3. Test Connection

```bash
cd backend
npm run sheets:test
```

Should show: ‚úÖ All tests passed!

### 4. Run Import

```bash
cd backend
npm run sheets:import
```

Wait 1-2 minutes while it imports everything.

## üìã Available Commands

## üîÑ How It Works

### First Import

1. **Customers** ‚Üí Creates all customers, relationship managers, locations
2. **Invoices** ‚Üí Creates invoices with line items, links to customers and products
3. **Payments** ‚Üí Creates payments, links to invoices, updates invoice status

### Subsequent Syncs

- **Customers**: Updates existing, creates new ones
- **Invoices**: Skips existing (by invoice number), creates new ones
- **Payments**: Skips duplicates (by date + customer + amount), creates new ones

## üêõ Common Issues

### "Credentials file not found"

**Fix**: Make sure `google-credentials.json` is in `backend/` folder

### "The caller does not have permission"

**Fix**: Share both Google Sheets with the service account email (from google-credentials.json)

### "Customer not found" for invoices

**Fix**: Run customer import first, or check customer name spelling matches exactly

### Some customers/products not linking

**Fix**: Check for typos or case differences in Google Sheets. The script matches case-insensitively but requires exact spelling.
