# Credits Fix & Customer Troubleshooting Guide

## Date: October 13, 2025

## Summary of Changes

### ‚úÖ Fixed: Automatic Credit Creation from Google Sheets Import

**Problem**: When payments exceeded invoice amounts or had no invoice specified, the excess wasn't being tracked as customer credit.

**Solution**: Enhanced the Google Sheets import script (`backend/src/scripts/import-from-google-sheets.ts`) to automatically handle:

#### 1. **Overpayment Credits**

- When a payment amount exceeds an invoice balance
- Example: Invoice balance ‚Ç¶100,000, Payment ‚Ç¶150,000
- Result: ‚Ç¶100,000 applied to invoice, ‚Ç¶50,000 created as OVERPAYMENT credit

#### 2. **Advance Payment Credits**

- When payment has no invoice number specified
- All payment amount converted to ADVANCE_PAYMENT credit
- Customer can apply these credits to future invoices

**How It Works:**

```typescript
// Before (old code):
- Applied full payment amount to invoice (even if > balance)
- Did not track overpayments
- Ignored payments without invoices

// After (new code):
- Calculate amountToApply = min(payment amount, invoice balance)
- Create credit for overpayment = payment amount - amountToApply
- Update payment.allocatedAmount and payment.creditAmount
- For payments without invoices, create advance payment credit
```

**Benefits:**

- ‚úÖ Accurate customer credit tracking
- ‚úÖ No more lost overpayments
- ‚úÖ Advance payments properly recorded
- ‚úÖ Credits available in Credit Management modal
- ‚úÖ Can be applied to future invoices

## üîç Customer Display Issue Troubleshooting

### Reported Issue

"Customers not showing in production - saying 'no customers found'"

### Diagnostic Steps

1. **Verify Data Exists**

   - Import logs show: **369 customers created**
   - Backend is running and database is synced
   - Data definitely exists in production database

2. **Possible Causes**

   **A. Rate Limiter Crashes (Most Likely)**

   - Backend logs show repeated rate limiter errors
   - Server crashes when requests come in
   - May prevent customer API from responding

   **B. Authentication Token Expired**

   - User may need to log out and log back in
   - Token refresh may have failed

   **C. Frontend Caching**

   - Browser cache may be serving old empty state
   - Hard refresh needed (Ctrl+F5)

   **D. API Route Permission Issue**

   - User role may not have access to customers endpoint
   - Check user permissions

### Quick Fixes to Try

#### Option 1: Hard Refresh Browser

```
1. Press Ctrl + F5 (Windows) or Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
2. Or open DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Network tab ‚Üí Check "Disable cache"
3. Reload page
```

#### Option 2: Re-login

```
1. Log out completely
2. Close all browser tabs of the CRM
3. Open fresh tab and log in again
4. Check customers page
```

#### Option 3: Check Different User

```
1. Try logging in with admin account
2. If admin can see customers, it's a permissions issue
3. If admin can't see, it's a system issue
```

#### Option 4: Check Browser Console

```
1. Press F12 to open DevTools
2. Go to Console tab
3. Refresh customers page
4. Look for red errors
5. Share screenshot with tech team
```

### Technical Details (For Developers)

**API Endpoint**: `GET /api/customers`

**Expected Response**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [...customers...],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 369,
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 50,
    "totalPages": 8,
    "hasNext": true,
    "hasPrev": false
  }
}
```

**Common Error Responses**:

- `401 Unauthorized` ‚Üí Token expired, need re-login
- `403 Forbidden` ‚Üí User lacks permissions
- `500 Internal Server Error` ‚Üí Backend crash (rate limiter issue)

**Check Backend Logs**:

```bash
fly logs --app clyne-paper-crm-backend --no-tail
```

Look for:

- `ValidationError: The Express 'trust proxy'` (rate limiter crash)
- `GET /api/customers 200` (successful request)
- `GET /api/customers 401` (auth failure)
- `GET /api/customers 500` (server error)

## Next Import Behavior

When you run the Google Sheets import again (after this deployment):

1. **New Payments with Invoices**:

   - If payment ‚â§ invoice balance: Full payment applied to invoice
   - If payment > invoice balance: Partial applied, excess becomes credit

2. **New Payments without Invoices**:

   - Full amount becomes ADVANCE_PAYMENT credit
   - Customer can apply later via Credit Management

3. **Existing Records**:
   - No automatic retroactive credit creation
   - Would need manual credit adjustment for already-imported payments
   - Or re-import after clearing old data

## Recommendations

### For Customers Not Showing:

1. Try hard refresh first (Ctrl+F5)
2. If that doesn't work, re-login
3. If still not working, check browser console for errors
4. Contact support with console error screenshot

### For Credits System:

- ‚úÖ Credits now automatically created from imports
- ‚úÖ Check Credit Management modal for each customer to see available credits
- ‚úÖ Use "Apply Credit to Invoice" to allocate advance payments
- ‚úÖ Customer ledger shows all credits with history

### For Historical Data:

If you need to create credits for payments that were already imported:

1. Use the Credit Management feature manually
2. Or run a data migration script to analyze existing payments vs invoices
3. Contact tech team for bulk credit creation if needed
