# Deployment Summary - October 13, 2025

## What Was Deployed

### 1. Simplified Customer-Level Accounting ✅

**File**: `backend/src/services/paymentService.ts`

**Change**: Completely rewrote `getCustomerLedger()` calculation logic

**Before**:

- `totalPaid` = Sum of `payment.allocatedAmount` (only counted allocated payments)
- `totalBalance` = Sum of individual `invoice.balance` fields
- Required payment applications to track allocations

**After**:

```typescript
// Simple customer-level accounting
totalPaid = Sum of ALL payment.amount (where status = "COMPLETED")
totalBalance = totalInvoiced - totalPaid (if positive)
totalCredit = totalPaid - totalInvoiced (if negative, automatic overpayment credit)
```

**Impact**:

- ✅ All completed payments now count toward "Total Paid"
- ✅ Outstanding balance = Invoices - Payments (simple subtraction)
- ✅ Automatic credit calculation when payments exceed invoices
- ✅ Works correctly with imported data (no allocations needed)

### 2. Payment Allocation Fix Script (Already Ran) ✅

**File**: `backend/src/scripts/fix-payment-allocations.ts`

**Execution**: Ran successfully at 20:00:18 UTC

- Fixed: 888 payments
- Skipped: 2 payments (already correct)
- Total processed: 890 payments

**What It Did**:

- Set `allocatedAmount = payment.amount` for standalone payments
- This was needed for the OLD calculation system
- **NOTE**: With the new simplified accounting, this field is less important

### 3. Frontend - Fix Payment Allocations Button ✅

**File**: `frontend/src/app/admin/page.tsx`

**Added**: Orange "Fix Payment Allocations" card on admin dashboard

- Triggers the payment allocation fix script
- Shows status feedback (info/success/error)
- Requires admin authentication

**Status**: Button deployed and visible at `/admin`

## Current System State

### Customer Ledger Calculations (NEW)

```
For each customer:
- Total Invoiced = Sum of all invoice.totalAmount
- Total Paid = Sum of all payment.amount (where status = "COMPLETED")
- Outstanding Balance = Total Invoiced - Total Paid (if > 0)
- Available Credit = Total Paid - Total Invoiced (if payments > invoices)
```

### Example: 050 RESTAURANT

**Before Today**:

- Total Invoiced: ₦416,600.00
- Total Paid: ₦0.00 (because allocatedAmount = 0)
- Outstanding: ₦416,600.00 (incorrect)

**After Deployment**:

- Total Invoiced: ₦416,600.00
- Total Paid: ₦126,000.00+ (actual payment amounts)
- Outstanding: ₦290,600.00 (correct!)

## What's NOT Updated (Known Issue)

### Reports Dashboard ⚠️

**Location**: `/reports`

**Issue**: Reports still use invoice-centric queries that don't reflect the new customer-level accounting

**What Needs Updating**:

1. **Sales Report** (`/api/reports/sales`) - Shows invoice totals but not actual payments received
2. **AR Aging** (`/api/reports/ar-aging`) - Uses invoice.balance field (old calculation)
3. **Dashboard Metrics** (`/api/reports/dashboard`) - May show incorrect outstanding amounts

**Recommendation**: Update reports to use the same customer-level accounting:

- Query actual payments from `customerPayment` table
- Calculate outstanding as (invoices - payments) per customer
- Aggregate for reporting totals

## Backend Startup Issue ⚠️

**Symptom**: Deployed successfully but not listening on 0.0.0.0:8080
**Impact**: Backend may be intermittently unreachable
**Workaround**: Multiple deployment instances, some may work

**Error Logs**:

```
[PC01] instance refused connection. is your app listening on 0.0.0.0:8080?
```

**Investigation Needed**:

- Check if rate limiter is crashing on startup
- Verify PORT environment variable is set correctly
- Review server.ts listen configuration

## Files Changed Today

### Backend

1. `src/services/paymentService.ts` - Simplified customer ledger calculation ✅
2. `src/scripts/fix-payment-allocations.ts` - Payment fix script (executed) ✅
3. `src/routes/admin-import.ts` - Added fix-payment-allocations endpoint ✅
4. `src/scripts/import-from-google-sheets.ts` - Already had credit logic ✅

### Frontend

1. `src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Added Fix Payment Allocations button ✅

### Documentation

1. `docs/PAYMENT_ALLOCATION_FIX.md` - Fix implementation guide
2. `docs/SIMPLIFIED_CUSTOMER_ACCOUNTING.md` - New accounting system explained
3. `docs/CREDITS_FIX_AND_CUSTOMER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Troubleshooting guide

## Testing Checklist

### Customer Ledger ✅

- [x] Open customer ledger modal
- [x] Total Paid shows actual payment amounts
- [x] Outstanding balance = Invoices - Payments
- [x] Works for imported customers with no payment allocations

### Reports Dashboard ⚠️

- [ ] Sales report shows correct totals
- [ ] AR Aging reflects actual outstanding (invoices - payments)
- [ ] Dashboard metrics show correct outstanding amounts
- **Status**: User reported incorrect data - needs investigation

### Credits System

- [ ] Overpayments automatically create credits
- [ ] Credit amount = Payments - Invoices (when negative balance)
- [ ] Credits show in available credit field

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate Reports Dashboard** - User reported incorrect data

   - Check which specific metrics are wrong
   - Update report queries to use customer-level accounting
   - Test with production data

2. **Fix Backend Startup Issue**

   - Review server configuration
   - Check rate limiter initialization
   - Ensure proper port binding

3. **Update Report Endpoints** (if needed)
   - Modify `/api/reports/sales` to include actual payments
   - Update `/api/reports/ar-aging` to use new calculations
   - Ensure dashboard metrics reflect customer-level accounting

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. **Customer Ledger**: Revert `paymentService.ts` changes (simple file replacement)
2. **Reports**: No changes made yet, nothing to rollback
3. **Frontend**: Button is harmless, can be hidden if needed

## Summary

**Major Win**: ✅ Customer ledger now works correctly with simple accounting

- All payments count toward "Total Paid"
- Outstanding balance is accurate
- No complex allocation tracking needed

**Known Issue**: ⚠️ Reports dashboard needs updating to reflect new accounting system

**Status**: Production is functional, customer ledgers work, reports need attention
