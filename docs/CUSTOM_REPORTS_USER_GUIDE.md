## Understanding Results

### Grouped Reports
When you select grouping, results show one row per group:

Example (Revenue by Location):
```
Location ID | Count | Total Amount | Average
loc-001     | 45    | ‚Ç¶1,250,000  | ‚Ç¶27,778
loc-002     | 32    | ‚Ç¶890,000    | ‚Ç¶27,813
loc-003     | 28    | ‚Ç¶760,000    | ‚Ç¶27,143
```

### Aggregated Reports
When no grouping is selected, results show summary metrics:

Example (Total Revenue):
```
Count: 234
Sum: ‚Ç¶5,670,000
Average: ‚Ç¶24,231
```

## Advanced Tips

### Combining Filters
You can use multiple filters together:
- Date Range + Status + Location
- Customer + Date Range + Payment Method

### Date Field Selection
For some models, you can choose which date field to filter on:
- `date` - Invoice date (default)
- `createdAt` - Creation date
- `paymentDate` - Payment date (for payments)

### Result Limits
- Default limit: 100 results
- Maximum: 1000 results
- For large datasets, use date ranges to narrow results

## Troubleshooting

### "No results returned"
- Check your date range (might be too narrow)
- Verify status filters match your data
- Try removing filters one by one

### "Error: Invalid model"
- Make sure you selected a model from the dropdown
- The model name is case-sensitive

### Slow performance
- Add date range filters to narrow the query
- Limit grouping to 1-2 fields
- Reduce the result limit
