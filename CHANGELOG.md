  - Waybill factory for inventory tracking
  - Scenario-based factories for complex workflows

#### Integration Tests
- **Invoice API Tests** (`/tests/integration/invoices.test.ts`):
  - Create invoice with single/multiple line items

  - Invoice listing with filtering and pagination
  - Invoice update and soft delete
  - Invoice sending via email (mocked)
  - Payment recording (full and partial payments)
  - Authorization checks
  - 11 comprehensive test cases covering the complete invoice lifecycle

#### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)
- **E2E Configuration** (`/tests/playwright.config.ts`):
  - Multi-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
  - Mobile viewport testing (Pixel 5, iPhone 12)
  - Screenshot and video capture on failure
  - HTML and JUnit reporting
  
- **Authentication E2E** (`/tests/e2e/auth/authentication.spec.ts`):
  - Login with valid/invalid credentials
  - Logout functionality
  - Session expiry handling
  - Form validation
  - Role-based access control
  - Password reset flow
  
- **Invoice Lifecycle E2E** (`/tests/e2e/invoices/invoice-lifecycle.spec.ts`):
  - Complete workflow: Login → Create Customer → Create Invoice → Send → Pay
  - 10-step comprehensive test covering entire invoice lifecycle
  - Partial payment handling with balance tracking
  - Validation error scenarios
  - Dashboard metrics verification

#### Security Tests
- **Authentication Security** (`/tests/security/auth-security.test.ts`):
  - Brute force protection via rate limiting
  - JWT token security (expiry, invalid signature, missing claims)
  - Password security (weak password rejection, hashing verification)
  - Session management (token invalidation, rotation)
  - Account lockout after failed attempts
  - Privilege escalation prevention
  - IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) protection

#### Performance Tests
- **Artillery Configuration** (`/tests/perf/artillery-config.yml`):
  - Load testing for dashboard, customers, invoices, inventory
  - 5 realistic user scenarios with weighted distribution
  - Phased load testing (warm-up, sustained, peak, cool-down)
  
- **k6 Load Tests** (`/tests/perf/k6-load-test.js`):
  - Progressive load testing (20 → 50 users)
  - Performance thresholds (p95 < 500ms, error rate < 5%)
  - Custom metrics for error tracking
  - Multiple scenario testing

#### CI/CD Integration
- **GitHub Actions Workflows**:
  - **Unit Tests** (`.github/workflows/unit-tests.yml`):
    - Matrix testing across Node.js 18.x and 20.x
    - Separate backend and frontend test jobs
    - Coverage upload to Codecov
    - Coverage threshold enforcement (90% backend, 80% frontend)
    - PR comment with coverage summary
    
  - **Integration Tests** (`.github/workflows/integration-tests.yml`):
    - PostgreSQL 15 service container
    - Database migration and seeding
    - Artifact upload for test results
    
  - **E2E Tests** (`.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`):
    - Multi-browser matrix testing
    - Full application startup (backend + frontend)
    - Screenshot/video capture on failure
    - Playwright report generation
    
  - **Security Tests** (`.github/workflows/security-tests.yml`):
    - Daily scheduled scans
    - npm audit for dependency vulnerabilities
    - OWASP ZAP baseline scan
    - Automatic GitHub issue creation for findings

#### Test Scripts
- Added comprehensive test scripts to `package.json`:
  - `npm test` - Run all unit tests
  - `npm run test:integration` - Run integration tests
  - `npm run test:e2e` - Run E2E tests with Playwright
  - `npm run test:e2e:ui` - Run E2E with Playwright UI
  - `npm run test:e2e:debug` - Debug E2E tests
  - `npm run test:security` - Run security tests
  - `npm run test:perf` - Run performance tests with Artillery
  - `npm run test:perf:k6` - Run load tests with k6
  - `npm run test:coverage` - Generate coverage reports

### Test Coverage
- **Backend**: Comprehensive integration tests for invoice API (11 test cases)
- **Frontend**: E2E tests for authentication and invoice lifecycle
- **Security**: 15+ security test scenarios covering OWASP Top 10
- **Performance**: Load testing configuration for 5 critical user flows
- **Total Test Cases**: 30+ test scenarios implemented

### Documentation
- **Test Plan**: 500+ line comprehensive guide on running, maintaining, and extending tests
- **Assumptions**: Detailed business logic and technical assumptions
- **TODO**: Clear list of manual intervention tasks with priority levels

### Infrastructure
- Test database setup with PostgreSQL
- Mock implementations ready for external services (SMTP, Payment Gateway, Google Sheets)
- Deterministic test data generation with factories
- Automated test data cleanup between runs

### Known Limitations
- Some tests require manual configuration (test database, CI secrets)
- Performance tests target moderate load (100 concurrent users max)
- Accessibility tests use automated tools (catching ~30% of issues)
- Visual regression testing not yet implemented

### Next Steps
See `/tests/TODO.md` for:
- Required CI/CD secrets configuration
- Additional test coverage for remaining routes
- Performance testing against staging environment
- Security hardening and penetration testing
